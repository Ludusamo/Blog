<h1 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h1>

<p>I am in my senior year of high school. If you are in the states, you will know how quickly motivation for seniors in high school to do work deteriorates. As such, I was finding that I was spending an increasing amount of time playing games and not doing more "worthwhile" things.</p>

<p>One of these games that I played was <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/">Guild Wars 2</a>. I picked up the game over the winter holidays to play with my friends, and I <strong>binged</strong> this game <strong>HARD</strong>. It was clearly becoming an issue. However, regardless of that, one feature that I really liked about this game was that it had a simple command called: <code>/age</code>. Essentially what this did, was just tell you how much time total you have spent playing the game.</p>

<p>This got me thinking, I should really start tracking the time I spend working and playing. Around that time, I got a Pebble Time Round, so I decided to get off my butt and make an application.</p>

<h1 id="idea">Idea</h1>

<p>So, the application would essentially do exactly what I described. On the simplest level, I want the application to be able to tell me the distribution of time that I have spent "playing" as opposed to "working". </p>

<p>I already have a preliminary version of the application up. Here are a couple pictures:</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/06/title.png" alt="title"></p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/06/select.png" alt="select">
Select between modes. <br>
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/06/start.png" alt="start">
Start Time. <br>
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/06/stop.png" alt="stop">
Stop Time. <br>
<img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/06/visualizer.png" alt="visualizer">
I even have a pretty nice first visualizer in there.</p>

<h1 id="future">Future</h1>

<p>Right now, the app is very basic. It only keeps track of the total amount of time "playing" or "working" in a single day. I might release a preliminary version with just this. However, I plan to expand it to store data over extended periods of time (companion application or online application?). But that will take a little bit of time. I also hope to tag this information, so I might even be able to see the distribution of time that I spend on individual things.</p>

<p>But for now, I am pretty proud that I finally got off my butt to do something that looks like it might actually reach completion.</p>

<p>Well, until next time.</p>
