# New Project!

I am addicted to starting new projects. This newest addition to the project list is a new website in order for me to
channel some of my creativity into another form. Now that I am working full time, I have wanted to find something
short and creative that I can do that doesn't take too much time. I am not really good at drawing, making music, or
other more "typical" methods of creating art. BUT I can **program**. So, without further ado, introducing:
[programmatic.art](https://programmatic.art).

# programmatic.art

## Goals

A while ago, I was watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBKwCCtWlUg) and saw a video about making
looping gifs in [Processing](https://processing.org/). In particular, I decided to use [p5js](https://p5js.org/) which
is the Javascript version of Processing. The following is an example:

I didn't quite get the gif perfectly looping, so I need to improve my methods of recording the gifs. However, this
should be sufficient to illustrate the little pieces of art I want to put up here.

So, I created a website which showcases a set of p5js sketches in a gallery view. Each of these gallery pages will build
up over time as I add new sketches. In order to add new pieces of art, I add to this
[yaml file](https://github.com/Ludusamo/programmatic-art/blob/main/res/metadata.yml). This lets the website know what is
the name of the javascript file to pull from a
[folder of p5 sketches](https://github.com/Ludusamo/programmatic-art/tree/main/res). The design of this website is a lot
like how I designed this blog website. I wanted these text files to be easily versioned, so I used GitHub pages to host
this website and I just versioned the sketches and configuration right in the same repository as the code for the
website.

## Influences

Some influences that I have seen other than The Coding Train for this project are
[bees & bombs](https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com) and [Saskia Freeke](https://sasj.tumblr.com/) both of whom create really
cool programmatic/looping pieces of artwork.

## Posting Frequency

I hope to post once a week to this website, so far I have gotten through 3 weeks!

# Conclusion

## I finished a project!

Scoping for this project was done a lot better than other projects I have had in the past. I am really happy that the
website is in a usable state, and I have also been able to stick to a schedule for making these.  This has so far been
a fun thing I can just hop on and do every weekend and keep the creative side of my brain stimulated. Hopefully, I will
be able to build up a nice big portfolio of this as just something cool that I can show others. If you want, you can
