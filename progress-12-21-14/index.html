<h2 id="todaysprogress">Today's Progress</h2>

<p>Well today was a whirlwind of a day. I forgot that I had an appointment today that took up most of the day. And on top of that, I think I caught a cold while I was out. Regardless, I ended up not being able to do the platforming that I wanted to yesterday. However we did get some things done as well as run into some issues.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Today the main issue had to do with something I had written in the beginning when I started this SDL/OpenGl engine. The root of the issue lay with how I was calculating the position in the spritesheet for a given sprite. I had forgotten to cast my final value to a float, and since I was dividing by an integer and expecting a fraction, C++ just rounded the number down to 0 at all times. This was easily fixed by just casting the result into a float. Note to future self: BE MORE CAREFUL AND TEST THINGS OUT BEFORE YOU MOVE ON!</p>

<h2 id="taskscompleted">Tasks Completed</h2>

<p>We have an adorable little walking animation now. Or at least I think it is adorable...</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1phBikX.gif" alt="Walking animation of little blue."></p>

<p>I may add in more intermediate frames in the future, but for now, this will suffice. I also began implementing a tiled map which I had forgotten to do. Here is a little gif of that in action: <br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/dvKojiC.gif" alt="Tiledmap demo"></p>

<p>The collision detection for this has not been implemented yet, but it <strong><em>shouldn't</em></strong> be too difficult to do (which means I am going to run into a whole bunch of errors and spend a whole lot of time fixing a small mistake).</p>

<p>Anyway, I am going to go to sleep now so I my potential cold doesn't get worse. Until next time.</p>
