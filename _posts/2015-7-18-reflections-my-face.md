## "My Face"
In the absence of knowing what to begin reflecting about in this piece, I will begin at the end. I thought the last line about the author remarking that his upper lip was fascinating in a bizarre way was funny. This remark made me laugh because I thought to myself, "This entire piece is bizarre".

In any case, despite how bizarre this piece was, what it did succeed in doing for me was it made me think about my own thoughts of my appearance. Part of the reason that I find this piece so bizarre is because I can't imagine viewing myself like he does. When I wake up and see myself in the mirror, I think that is remarkable how little I change. It isn't until I look at photos from previous years that I am shocked at how much I change. However, that is becoming less and less true as the years go on. If I look at images from only a year or two back, I am actually shocked how _little_ I changed.

What I will say is that I do understand his slight fear in his appearance changing to him on a daily basis. I completely understand the feeling of realizing certain things are so variable and not necessarily all under our own control. There is something a little scary about the moment that you realize that you cannot control something that you may desperately want to control.
