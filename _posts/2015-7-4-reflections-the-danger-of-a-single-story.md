## "The Danger of a Single Story"
Before I delve into the meat of this TED talk (if you are interested, this is the [link](http://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story?language=en) to the video), I would like to talk about some of the initial thoughts I had when Ms. Adichie first began her speech. What resonated with me most was when she was talking about how reading foreign stories shaped her writing as a child. Specifically, these foreign stories made her writing filled with "foreign" aspects, or more simply put, similar to the stories that she read. This struck me in particular because, as I look back at my own writing in elementary and middle school, it is very clear that the stories that I wrote back then were HEAVILY influenced by the stories that I read. I love reading fictional/fantasy stories and for me that transformed into loving to write fictional/fantasy stories. But at the same time, it is painfully apparent where I got the influence for my writing, at least to me, and I find that it is not difficult for me to see where I got my plot devices and the structures of my stories.

But I digress, Ms. Adichie is talking of getting locked into these single viewpoints, much like how my story writing became, and the importance of diversifying our view of the world in order toget a "complete" or more complete story. As she continued her speech, I began to remember an article that I was reading earlier this week. That article was titled ["Is marketing driven by culture, or is culture driven by marketing?"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/marketing-driven-culture-andy-badalamenti). Clearly, there is an argument that could be made for both ways, but I think everyone would agree that both marketing and culture fuel each other. But, the connection that I drew between this article and Ms. Adichie's speech is the capability of media to shape our views. As much as we would like to deny it, the media that we consume is too often the only exposure that we have to certain topics. If anything, Ms. Adichie's speech has given me another reminder ofhow narrow my view of the world is. 

However, the counter arguments to these stereotypes are often:

- Oh its just human nature.
- I am just trying to keep myself safe. (Often said in the face of being wary around certain types of people.)

Whether stereotypes are inherently morally wrong or right, I think Ms. Adichie addressed them rather well. It isn't that stereotypes are necessarily all untrue, but rather that they don't give us the full picture. Sure, and I am going to quote an economics book titled *Naked Economics* by Charles Wheelan, "we are taught from a young age that one should never judge a book by its cover. *But we must; it is often all we get to see*". This particular quote stuck with me and parallels my own personal beliefs on this topic. This is why I could not agree with Ms. Adichie more. Our information is not perfect and she acknowledges that. But, at the same time, she urges us to strive to gain more "complete" information.

This serves as a constant reminder to me that I must always keep my mind open.
