## IB Literature and Language Assignment
This summer, as an assignment for my IB Literature and Language course, I am to write at least 1000 words reflecting on a range of different media. The medium in which I was left to be able to write my reflections was left up to me so long as it would allow me to keep a timestamp on my work. So, I decided that this was a good location for me to use since I already had it set up.

So, starting this weekend, I will be making weekly posts on here. The first one should be coming out very shortly.
