## First Week Complete!
Milestone complete? Achievement unlocked? Well, in either case, this being my first real job definitely makes it a milestone in my life.

## How it went:
Well, this obviously was a new experience for me seeing as how I have never had a real job before. There are definitely some things I will have to learn. To begin, some negatives:

### WOW is it hard to sit in one place for 8 hours...
I mean I suppose I do it at home already, but working for 8 hours is difficult. Now don't get me wrong, I have a lunch break, and I am free to move around whenever, but it is pretty taxing to work for so long.

### Doing one thing all day can become a little dull...
I love game development. That was how I began programming in the first place. But wow, it becomes even a little dull for me by the end of the day. I need to start planning out my days better at the beginning so I can have some other tasks to break up the work day for me.

Now, I wouldn't want to only present the negatives, let's end on a positive note!

### Good job me for choosing a job that I ACTUALLY enjoy.
Despite me saying that the game development starts to get dull by the end of the day, I still LOVE game dev. I have a hard time imagining how I would go through a work day without actually caring about what I do. I mean I am sure I would be able to, but this just makes it A LOT easier and even fun in the process.

### Fantastic work environment.
BrightLogic is a relatively small company, but everything feels so friendly. Everyone around knows each other and I know I can go to anyone at any point to ask for help if I need it. The environment is overall just very supportive, and so far I am glad that this is the company with my first work experience.

## Final Remarks
It has been a great week in many ways. I am glad that this was a successful first work week. I have many things to learn and many things I should improve myself on. But for now, here is to many more years of work! CHEERS!
