## BrightLogic
Today was my first day interning at [BrightLogic](http://brightlogic.com. This is my first experience working and I was very excited to get started.

Even though today was mostly spent setting up and getting acquainted with our work environment, it was still a tiring day. I completed setting up my little cubicle space along with meeting everyone in the office.

## My Day
I spent the day learning about the interfaces that I would be using in order to begin working on applications for BrightLogic's ActiveFloor. I also spent some time brainstorming ideas for applications and games that I may want to implement for the ActiveFloor.

Overall, it was a pretty good day and I look forward to learning and doing more tomorrow.
