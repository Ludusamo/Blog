<p>Where it began.</p>

<p>Because the STEM challenge originally was a competition about STEM concepts, I thought about making a game about the science that I am currently most interested in: computer science. However, a couple issues arise:</p>

<p>Comp Sci games usually become modding games. <br>
The programming becomes more prevalent than gameplay. <br>
Can become frustrating very quickly. <br>
So, in the beginning I just scrapped the comp sci idea and just tried to find another idea. But then, an idea hit me.</p>

<p>Concept</p>

<p>The concept I came up with spawns off of the Hacker series of game mechanics on Three Hundred Game Mechanics by Sean Howard. I wanted to make a similar concept that would be inside a computer so kinda like this hack idea, but it would be following a little character which would be a representation of a program.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lwC9sd9.gif" alt="Image of little blue animated"></p>

<p>Forgive the programmer art but this is what the main character will look like (subject to change). He is the little blue program that asks for our help because he forgets who he is and we have to find the “address” in memory where his “memories” are. Along the way, I plan on teaching various concepts of computer science by helping fellow programs in this little world. Essentially, its my own spin on the amnesia trope that we often see in stories but with a little twist. The working title is The Little Blue Program.</p>

<p>This would be my elevator pitch: Embark on a journey to help a little program lost in the big computer world to find his memories in some address. The game will utilize metroidvania style 2D platforming and puzzles in order to teach players the wonders of computer science all while they help their new little friend make it in this world.</p>

<p>Conclusion and the Future</p>

<p>This is one of the first times that one of my ideas has gotten me so excited to create and I am hoping to share the experience here. I will be posting any new art assets or music that I make here as well as little demos when the coding gets done. But for now, I suppose this is a good place to sign off. I am excited to make progress with this in the next few weeks.</p>
