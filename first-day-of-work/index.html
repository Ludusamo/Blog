<h2 id="brightlogic">BrightLogic</h2>

<p>Today was my first day interning at <a href="http://brightlogic.com">BrightLogic</a>. This is my first experience working and I was very excited to get started.</p>

<p>Even though today was mostly spent setting up and getting acquainted with our work environment, it was still a tiring day. I completed setting up my little cubicle space along with meeting everyone in the office.</p>

<h2 id="myday">My Day</h2>

<p>I spent the day learning about the interfaces that I would be using in order to begin working on applications for BrightLogic's ActiveFloor. I also spent some time brainstorming ideas for applications and games that I may want to implement for the ActiveFloor.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a pretty good day and I look forward to learning and doing more tomorrow.</p>
