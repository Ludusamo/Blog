<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=242">link</a> to the problem.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>First task that I had to accomplish was to figure out how to determine if they were crossing or not. This ended up to be rather simple since their start and end Y positions are fixed. What it turns out to be is that one cow's path must "surround" the other to be crossing.</p>

<p>So essentially: <br>
Given a cow A with path (x1, x2) and cow B with path (x3, x4). They would cross if: </p>

<pre><code>(x1 &lt; x3 &amp;&amp; x2 &gt; x4) // Essentially saying that A "surrounds" B
</code></pre>

<pre><code>(x3 &lt; x1 &amp;&amp; x4 &gt; x2) // Also true if B surrounds A
</code></pre>

<p>After establishing that, in order to simplify the problem, I ordered all of the cows based on their start positions in order. <br>
What this accomplished was that I knew as I went along, all the cows prior to the one being checked would have their first value less than the current cow. This means I just had to check if there was a cow previous to it with a larger ending position in order for there to exist a cow that surrounds it. So, I simply kept track of the largest end position. If it was greater, than I knew that the cow would cross with a cow even if I didn't know which one.</p>

<p>If I left it here, then my solution would be wrong. There may be cases where a cow that would have crossed it hadn't occured yet. So I simply checked backwards as well. As I went forward I also kept a list of ones that I already checked off as not safe. Going backwards got all of the rest.</p>

<p>This was my full solution:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

#define pb push_back
#define mp make_pair
#define a first
#define b second
#define MAX_N = 100000

/* N cows (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000)
 * Road runs horizontally
 * One sided described by y = 0; other by y = 1
 * The cows will cross the road based on a_i and b_i which are their initial and final x positions
 * 1M &lt;= a_i, b_i &lt;= 1M
 * Cows are "safe" if their path does not intersect another cows's
 *
 * Objective: Count the number of safe cows.
*/

using namespace std;

typedef pair&lt;int, int&gt; cow;  
typedef vector&lt;cow&gt; VP;

int N, output, checked[100000];  
VP cows;

bool compareCows(const cow &amp;a, const cow &amp;b) {  
    return a.a &lt; b.a;
}

void solve() {  
    output = 0; 
    int nSC = 0; // not safe cows
    int maxB = -2000000;
    for (int a = 1; a &lt; N; a++) {
        if (maxB &gt;= cows[a].b) {
            checked[a] = 1;
                nSC++;  
        }
        maxB = (maxB &gt; cows[a].b) ? maxB : cows[a].b;
    }
    int minB = 2000000; 
    for (int a = N - 1; a &gt;= 0; a--) {
        if (minB &lt;= cows[a].b &amp;&amp; checked[a] != 1) nSC++;    
        minB = (minB &lt; cows[a].b) ? minB : cows[a].b;
    }
    output = N - nSC;
}

int main() {  
    ifstream fin("crossings.in");
        fin &gt;&gt; N;
        int a, b;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
            fin &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; b;
            cows.pb(mp(a, b));
        }
        sort(cows.begin(), cows.end(), compareCows);
    fin.close();

    solve();

    ofstream fout("crossings.out");
    fout &lt;&lt; output &lt;&lt; endl;
    fout.close();
    return 0;
