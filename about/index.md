## Brendan Horng

I am a teenage technology enthusiast, programmer, and student. I am currently enrolled in the Academy for the Advancement of Science and Technology at Bergen County Academies.

I enjoy spending my time working on various programming projects (some of which you will see me write about here), spending time with my friends and family, and taking long walks.
